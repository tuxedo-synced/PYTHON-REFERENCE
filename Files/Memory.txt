File Detection :-
#   import os 
#   os.path.exits({file_path})
#   os.path.isfile({file_path})
#   os.path.isfile({file_path}) and {file_path}.endswith("{.csv / .json}") # default .txt so no need of .endswith representation .

Create CSV :-
#   import csv
#   with open({file_path},"w",newline = "") as file:
#       writer = csv.writer(file)
#       for row in writer:
#           writer.writerow(row)
#   newline parameter is added to avoid extra blanck places (can also check by removing the paraameter and running it) .

Create JSON :-
#   import json
#   represented by dictionaries
#   with open({file_path},"w",newline=""):
#       json.dump({data_to_write},file,indent={number_of_spaces_for_indentation})


File Append :-
#   with open({file_path},"a") as file:
#       file.write({data_to_append} + "\n")
#       the {data_to_append} is appended to the file the number of times user excecutes the script .

File Write (same for all file types -> .txt , .csv , .json ) :-
#   with open({file_path},"w") as file:
#       file.write({data_to_write} + "\n") # \n is added only if needed .
#       while writing data inside any file , the file is first cleared (also created if not exist) and then append the {data_to_write} .

Reading a txt file :-
#   with open({file_path},"r") as file:
#       content = file.read()
#       the {content} contain entire .txt file data .

Reading a CSV file :-
#   import csv
#   with open({file_path},"r") as file:
#       content = csv.reader(file)
#       print(content)
#       for every_line in content:
#           print(every_line)
#       file.seek(0)
#       for every_line in contain:
#           print(every_line[0], end = " ")
#           print(every_line[1], end = " ")
#           print(every_line[2], end = "\n")

Reading a JSON file :-
#   import json 
#   with open({file_path},"r") as file:
#       content = file.load(file)
#       print(content)
#       we can also print specific key values by content["specific_key"]

# General errors cause :-
# FileNotFoundError
# PermissionError
